# AZ-500-Study Notes and other resources
Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) Study Notes

Created during the first week of May, 2023 using Microsoft Exam guide, Microsoft Articiles, Google Bard, OpenAI ChatGPT and all my notes and reference materials used during certification prep. 

I have them listed in word, pdf and generated a wiki in the hopes the community may use. Any content made via  ChatGPT - may be out of date.
Ensure you combine this with Microsoft official AZ-500 Study material / Learning Modules. 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-500/

I added the hands on modules at the end of each Microsoft material which I am using to help me prepare for labs during exam and develop any missing hands on experience.

Best of luck in your studies!! 

Cheers,

Alex
