# AZ-500-Study
Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) Study Notes

Created during the first week of May, 2023 using Microsoft Exam guide and ChatGPT. 

The following are the notes I have created for studying AZ-500. I have them listed in word, pdf and generated a wiki in the hopes the community may use. Any content made via ChatGPT may be out of date.
I suggest using this combined with Microsoft AZ-500 Study material.

I wadded the hands on modules at the end of each Microsoft material which I am using to help me prepare for labs during exam and develop any missing hands on experience.

Best of luck in your studies if you are using and feel free to request edit if you would like to help update.

Cheers,

Alex
